# HeliosOS: AI-Powered Cloud Operating System - Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for transforming HeliosOS into a fully functional, AI-powered cloud operating system. The goal is to create an intuitive and powerful environment that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance user interaction, automate tasks, and seamlessly integrate open-source applications. The target audience includes business professionals, students, and programmers, each with unique needs that the system aims to address.

## 2. Core AI Capabilities

The AI in HeliosOS will serve as the central intelligence layer, enabling users to interact with the system and applications through natural language commands and instructions. Key AI capabilities will include:

### 2.1. Command Reception and Execution

*   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** The AI will be capable of understanding complex natural language commands, translating them into actionable system or application-specific instructions.
*   **Intent Recognition:** Identifying the user's intent (e.g., 


open an application, create a document, search for a file) from natural language input.
*   **Parameter Extraction:** Extracting relevant parameters from the command (e.g., application name, file path, content for a document).
*   **Command Execution Engine:** A robust engine that translates the AI's understanding into actual system calls or API interactions with applications.

### 2.2. Action on Applications

*   **Application Control:** The AI will be able to launch, close, switch between, and manage applications based on user commands.
*   **In-Application Actions:** For supported applications, the AI will be able to perform specific actions within the application (e.g., in a word processor: 


create a new document, save a file, format text; in a spreadsheet: create a new sheet, enter data, apply formulas; in a code editor: open a file, run a script, debug code).
*   **Contextual Awareness:** The AI should maintain context of the active application and user's workflow to provide more relevant and efficient assistance.

### 2.3. AI-Powered Assistance and Automation

*   **Proactive Suggestions:** Based on user habits and current tasks, the AI can proactively suggest actions or applications.
*   **Workflow Automation:** Users can define multi-step workflows that the AI can execute on command (e.g., "Prepare my weekly report" which could involve opening a spreadsheet, fetching data, generating a summary, and drafting an email).
*   **Intelligent Search:** Enhanced search capabilities across files, applications, and the web, powered by AI to understand intent and provide more accurate results.

## 7. Consolidation of Flask and FastAPI Functionality

Currently, HeliosOS utilizes both Flask and FastAPI, leading to some functional overlap. To achieve a more cohesive and efficient architecture, the following consolidation strategy will be adopted:

*   **FastAPI as the Primary Backend:** FastAPI will be the primary backend framework for all core OS services, including AI command processing, application orchestration, file system operations, and system monitoring. Its asynchronous capabilities are well-suited for real-time interactions and high concurrency required by an operating system.
*   **Flask for Authentication and Auditing (Transitional):** The existing Flask application, particularly its robust authentication and auditing features (`app/auth.py`, `app/models.py`, and related routes in `app/routes.py`), will be retained initially. These functionalities will be exposed as APIs that the FastAPI application can consume.
*   **Migration Plan:** Over time, the authentication and auditing functionalities from Flask will be gradually migrated to FastAPI to achieve a fully unified backend. This migration will involve:
    *   Reimplementing user authentication and session management in FastAPI, leveraging `SQLAlchemy` models for database interaction.
    *   Adapting the existing `CommandAudit` and `AIInteraction` models for use within the FastAPI context and ensuring proper logging and retrieval of audit data.
    *   Deprecating and eventually removing the Flask application once all its critical functionalities are successfully migrated to FastAPI.

This phased approach allows for leveraging existing stable components while moving towards a more streamlined and performant architecture for HeliosOS.
